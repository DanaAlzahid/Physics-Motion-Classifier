Physics Motion Classifier

A machine learning project that classifies uniform, accelerated, and oscillatory motion using basic physics-based features: displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time.

üîç Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates how classical motion types in physics can be modeled and accurately classified using Python and a Random Forest Classifier. Each type of motion is simulated, features are extracted, and a model is trained to recognize patterns in the data.

‚öôÔ∏è Features Used

Time
Displacement
Velocity
Acceleration

ü§ñ Model

Algorithm: Random Forest
Accuracy: 100% on the test set
Evaluation: All predictions were correct
Confusion Matrix: No misclassifications
Precision / Recall / F1-score: 1.00 for all classes

üß† Why This Matters

Applies machine learning to physics simulation
Visualizes motion in a data-driven context
Demonstrates that classical physics problems can benefit from AI tools

üìà Output

The model correctly distinguished all three motion types with a perfect confusion matrix and classification report.
