# Physics Motion Classifier

This project classifies **uniform**, **accelerated**, and **oscillatory** motion using physics-based features: displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time.

---

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates how different types of classical motion can be simulated, visualized, and classified using Python. The project includes:

- Data generation  
- Feature extraction  
- Visualization  
- Classification using a Decision Tree model  

---

## Features Used

- Time  
- Displacement  
- Velocity  
- Acceleration  

---

## Model

- **Algorithm**: Decision Tree Classifier  
- **Accuracy**: 100% on the test set (after train-test split)  
- **Evaluation**: All predictions were correct  
- **Confusion Matrix**: No misclassifications  
- **Precision / Recall / F1-score**: 1.00 for all classes  
- **Top Feature**: Acceleration contributed most to the modelâ€™s predictions  

---

## Key Findings

- **Acceleration** is the strongest predictor of motion type  
- Motion classes are clearly separable using basic physics features  
- Oscillatory motion is more scattered and harder to model visually, but still classified correctly  
- **PCA** confirmed the structure and separability of the dataset
